 * \brief Supports the communication of a plugin that has been launched via MPI_Comm_spawn.
 * The communication is driven by the host, and follows the following convention.
 *   -# All communication is via printable character strings sent as MPI_CHAR using MPI_Send / MPI_Recv
 *   -# Strings are sent from host to guest by first sending the length of the string as an MPI_INT, then
 * 	the string itself.
 *   -# Strings are sent from guest to host by sending the length, then listening for the return
 * 	of an MPI_INT answer. If non-zero, the string is sent.
 *   -# The host sends an initial string containing the name of the host program, its
 * 	version number, and the desired file into which the guest's standard output should be redirected.
 * 	It then waits for strings to be sent to it, which, on receipt, it interprets and
 * 	obeys according to further conventions established between the two programs.
 *   -# The guest indicates termination by sending an empty string.
 *
 *   Example of use: @include plugin-examples-1.cpp
